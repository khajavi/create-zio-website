# Create ZIO Website

To install a new ZIO website for your ZIO project, you can use the following command.

```bash
npx @zio.dev/create-zio-website <name>
```

> **Note**
> You should not use this command directly to create a documentation website for your project, unless you know what you're doing. Instead, we have a `zio-sbt-website` plugin which is responsible for creating a website for your project through sbt commands.
